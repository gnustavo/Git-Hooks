{{$NEXT}}

2.6.3     2018-02-28 09:31:25-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - PrepareLog: the tests required a feature implemented on Git 1.7.2. It was
    rewritten to support Git 1.7.1.

2.6.2     2018-02-27 14:24:12-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - CheckJira: some error messages weren't expanding the commit SHA1 correctly.

2.6.1     2018-02-26 18:44:54-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - PrepareLog: require Git >= 2.8.0 in order to insert issues in the log
    message trailers. Previously we required Git >= 2.7.0, but they didn't
    implement a feature we use.

2.6.0     2018-02-26 16:38:54-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - The plugins which were associated with the pre-commit, commit-msg, and
    post-commit hooks are now also associated with the pre-applypatch,
    applypatch-msg, and post-applypatch hooks, when is makes sense.

  - CheckLog: complains about duplicate Signed-off-by trailers in commit
    messages.

  - CheckReference: new option require-annotated-tag.

  - PrepareLog: new plugin associated with the prepare-commit-msg hook. For now
    it makes it possible to insert an issue ID in the commit message, inferring
    it from the current branch's name.

  - The distribution now installs a three-line script called githooks.pl which
    can be used as a generic driver for Git::Hooks.

  [Documentation]

  - The README and Tutorials that were kept in the GitHub wiki are now
    internalized in the distribution as POD files.

2.5.0     2018-02-16 16:44:43-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Documentation]

  - Added a SYNOPSIS section to the POD of all plugins showing an example of the
    Git configuration for it.

  - Improved almost all error messages making them more useful to the end-user.

  - The SHA1s appearing in error messages are shortened to make them easier to
    read by the end-user.

  [New feature]

  - GitHooks: deprecate the errors/get_errors methods and replace them by the
    newly added fault/get_faults methods. The new ones have a different
    signature which is more flexible.

2.4.0     2018-02-11 14:08:19-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New feature]

  - CheckLog: implement option deny-merge-reverts.

  [Fix]

  - Notify: fix numstat lines for binary files. Since they don't have lines, an
    hyphen is shown for them.

2.3.0     2017-12-14 11:34:40-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - The GitHooks plugin implements two new methods: get_config_boolean and
    get_config_integer. They're used whenever we want to get a configuration
    value explicitly as a boolean or an integer, following git-config's
    documentation about typed options. If the option's value doesn't comply with
    git-config's syntax specification for booleans or integers the methods
    croak, making clear to the user that she has a configuration
    error. Moreover, this allows the user to specify booleans and integers in
    whatever syntax they prefer, according to git-config's specification.

  [Changes]

  - Notify: in the notification headers, replace 'BY:' by 'PUSHED BY:' to make
    it clear that we're talking about the user who pushed the commits being
    notified about.

  - Support Git 1.7.1, which is the version installed by default in CentOS
    6. There was no code changes to make it so. We only changed the check make
    during the building of the module to allow the use of version
    1.7.1. Previously we supported from version 1.7.2 on.

  [Fix]

  - Notify: use the option i18n.commitEncoding to decode commit information
    before inserting it into the notifications.

  - The GitHooks::get_config method now treats the $var argument as
    case-insensitive, following what the git-config documentation implies.

2.2.1     2017-12-12 14:36:38-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - The new Notify plugin unearthed an unintended dependency on Git 2.7.0. This
    version fix it to make Git::Hooks work with at least Git 1.7.2.

2.2.0     2017-12-11 20:28:45-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - Notify: a new plugin that can be configured to send email notifications to
    specific addresses telling about new commits modifying specific paths inside
    the repository.

  - New method GitHooks::repository_name returns the name of the repository in
    the server.

2.1.8     2017-10-29 21:51:37-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - The githooks.checkjira.jql and githooks.checkjira.ref-jql options were being
    used as multi-valued, but this was never the intention. The idea is to
    evaluate only the most specific value of each option so that one can
    specialize checks on specific repositories.

2.1.7     2017-10-21 23:27:42-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - Remove directive githooks.nocarp which had no meaning since v2.0.0.

  - Fix CheckWhitespace::check_affected_refs so that it works with newly created
    or just deleted branches.

  [Thanks]

  - Thanks to @boudekerk for referring me to both problems.

2.1.6     2017-09-26 18:31:44-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - Fix the githooks.nocarp directive which was broken since v2.0.1.

2.1.5     2017-09-21 22:32:00-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Messages sent to Gerrit are truncated to less than 64kB. Otherwise they
    aren't saved and Gerrit logs an error.

  - The method G::R::P::GH::get_sha1 wasn't working at all! Since it was only
    used by CheckCommit's check_post_commit method, it seems that nobody ever
    used it.

2.1.4     2017-09-21 08:49:37-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - CheckWhitespace was trying to get error messages from STDERR instead of
    STDOUT, which besides making it be mute about them, could make it hang if
    there was too much errors to show.

2.1.3     2017-08-05 23:55:55-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Git::Hooks was broken for Gerrit since v2.0.0.

  - CheckJira's deprecated options (issuetype and status) were broken if
    their values contained whitespace.

2.1.2     2017-08-03 09:58:07-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - A simple improvement over the previous fix of CheckLog.

2.1.1     2017-08-02 23:34:44-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - CheckLog was considering every file in the repository when a new branch
    or tag was pushed, during the pre-receive and the update hooks. Now it
    can calculate correctly the files affected by the new commits pushed
    along with the new commit.

2.1.0     2017-07-12 15:06:42-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - CheckJira and CheckLog now admit a new option called 'noref' allowing
    one to explicitly exclude some references from the checks performed by
    these plugins.

  [Fixes]

  - The githooks.checkcommit.check-code directive now works when one pushes
    more than one commit.

2.0.1     2017-06-23 10:53:06-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  - Official release of version 2.0.

  [Documentation]

  - The TUTORIAL.pod file was removed and its contents were moved to the
    projects wiki at https://github.com/gnustavo/Git-Hooks/wiki.

  [Internal changes]

  - Substituted Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker::Awesome for
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker::Custom as a Dist::Zilla dependency.

2.0.0     2017-06-15 20:42:17-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo (TRIAL RELEASE)

  This is a major new version of Git::Hooks and there is a few incompatible
  changes mentioned below. Most of them affect only hook and plugin
  developers, but not users. As a user you'll be affected only if you use
  the CheckStructure plugin, which was removed from the distribution. If you
  depend on it, you may reimplement its checks using the CheckFile and the
  CheckReference plugins.

  [Incompatible changes]

  - Replace the Git module by the Git::Repository module as the underlying
    git wrapper. This means that hooks now receive a Git::Repository object
    as their first argument instead of a Git::More object, which may affect
    the code of hooks and plugins.

  - The Git::More module was transformed into the
    Git::Repository::Plugin::GitHooks module to take advantage of
    Git::Repository's plugin architecture. This means that the
    Git::Repository object passed to hooks will have the
    Git::Repository::Plugin::GitHooks plugin enabled, which brings most of
    the methods previously provided by Git::More.

  - The Git::Hooks::nocarp method was removed. The 'nocarp' function is
    meant to be enabled via the githooks.nocarp configuration option only.

  - Git::Hooks now only exports the hook directives and the 'run_hook'
    function. All the other functions previously implemented by it are now
    provided by Git::Repository::Plugin::GitHooks.

  - Git::Repository::Plugin::GitHooks's methods 'get_commit', 'get_commits',
    and 'get_affected_ref_commits' now return Git::Repository::Log objects
    instead of naked hashes to represent commits.

  - The CheckStructure plugin was removed from the distribution. Its
    funcionality is provided by the CheckFile and the new CheckReference
    plugins.

  [New features]

  - New options for the 'githooks' section: 'error-header' and
    'error-footer'. These allow for the injection of a header and/or a
    footer along with Git::Hooks's error messages.

  - CheckReference: new plugin for checking branch names.

  - CheckJira: new options: 'jql', 'ref-jql'. These allow one to use JIRA's
    JQL expressions to impose restrictions on the JIRA issues cited on
    commit messages.

  - CheckJira: new option 'skip-merges' to avoid checking merge commits.

  - CheckCommit: new configuration option 'merger' to define the users
    allowed to push merge commits.

  - CheckCommit: new configuration option 'push-limit' to specify the
    maximum number of commits that may be pushed at once over a branch.

  - CheckFile: New configuration option 'basename.sizelimit' to specify size
    limits per file name.

  - The Git::Hooks documentation now contains a section for plugin
    developers.

  [Deprecations]

  - Remove the deprecated configuration options
    'githooks.gerrit.review-label', 'githooks.gerrit.vote-ok', and
    'githooks.gerrit.vote-nok'.

  - CheckJira: deprecates the configuration options 'project', 'status', and
    'issuetype'. They're better implemented by the new 'jql' option.

1.16.0    2017-05-20 18:48:38-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - CheckLog: New option title-match to check the commit message title.

  [Fixes]

  - (PR#37) Specifying multiple anonymous subs for the same hooks did not
    work. Only the first sub that was defined would actually be called. Fixed
    by Dave Rolsky.

  - Test suite bug triggered by Git 2.13.0.

1.15.1    2017-03-02 14:26:16-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - The old t/test-functions.pl file was turned into a proper module as
    Git::Hooks::Test, which made the tests simpler.

  - Add Travis CI support in GitHub.

  - Use Test::Requires::Git to check the Git version during testing.

  [Thanks]

  - Thanks for the good folks at CV-Library for a bunch of pull requests
    that made most of this new version.
    http://tech-blog.cv-library.co.uk/2017/02/16/february-pull-request-challenge/

1.15.0    2017-01-04 21:45:26-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - New method Git::More::hookname returns the name of the current hook.

  [Fixes]

  - Fix regression on Git::More::get_commits

1.14.2    2016-11-25 10:44:51-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Gerrit 2.13 slightly changed how it passes information to the hooks and
    we had to make some changes to accommodate it.

1.14.1    2016-11-06 17:02:19-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - As it were the boolean return from the hooks were being
    disregarded. Git::Hooks considered a failure only when some hooks
    invoked the Git::Hooks::error method. Now it considers a failure if any
    hook returns false OR if any one of them invoked the Git::Hooks::erro
    method. Some hooks weren't returning the correct boolean value that
    Git::Hooks expected and they were fixed too.

1.14.0    2016-10-15 09:47:47-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - Add new option githooks.gerrit.notify to specify who should be notified
    when a review is cast into Gerrit.

1.13.1    2016-08-07 21:16:40-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Git::More::get_commits always returned an empty list when invoked in a
    post-receive and post-update hook so that these hooks really didn't work
    before.

  - CheckJira: Fix call to JIRA's method to insert a comment.

  [Changes]

  - CheckJira: The githooks.checkjira.comment option must be set to 'all' if
    you do not want to restrict its visibility. Previously it was documented
    that you should leave it without value. This is not really an
    incompatible change, since the comment insertion was performed in the
    post-receive/post-update hooks which weren't working anyway.

1.13.0    2016-07-02 16:36:38-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - Add new boolean option githooks.gerrit.auto-submit to submit the change
    in Gerrit automatically if all hooks succeed.

  - Add new options for specifying Gerrit votes:
    githooks.gerrit.votes-to-approve and
    githooks.gerrit.votes-to-reject. They allow for voting in multiple
    labels depending on the outcome of the hooks.

  [Deprecations]

  - The options githooks.gerrit.review-label, githooks.gerrit.vote-nok, and
    githooks.gerrit.vote-ok are deprecated and should be replaced by the new
    options mentioned above. These old options will continue to work for a
    few more versions and cannot be used together with the new ones. They
    must be completely replaced.

1.12.5    2016-05-31 07:45:06-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - Fix typo that was preventing githooks.checkjira.comment to work.

1.12.4    2016-03-29 17:00:03-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - CheckFile: Pass the GIT_COMMIT environment variable to the external
    commands.

1.12.3    2016-02-15 13:50:36-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - Fix Git::More::get_commits for all branches.

  [Thanks]

  - Thanks to @boudekerk for referring me to this problem in
    https://github.com/gnustavo/Git-Hooks/issues/26.

1.12.2    2016-02-09 11:07:58-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - Fix Git::More::get_commits for new branches.

  [Thanks]

  - Many thanks to @ate, @boudekerk, and @schans who showed me the bug and
    how to fix it in https://github.com/gnustavo/Git-Hooks/issues/24.

1.12.1    2016-01-16 19:14:52-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]

  - Remove dependency on Data::Util and add dependency on Sub::Util.

1.12.0    2015-09-27 10:18:35-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Incompatible changes]

  - CheckCommit: The recently implemented githooks.checkcommit.check-ref
    option is being replaced by another one called
    githooks.checkcommit.check-code, which performs the checks for every
    commit in an update or pre-receive hook, not for every affected
    reference. Now it applies also to the local pre-commit hook.
    
    The githooks.checkcommit.check-ref option was ill-conceived. The
    CheckCommit plugin is meant to check "commits", not "references". As
    such, all checks should apply to the local commit being constructed in a
    pre-commit hook and to all commits being pushed in an update or
    pre-receive hook.
    
    The callback routines associated with the option now get three
    arguments ($git, $commit, $ref) instead of two ($git, $ref).

    Since the ...check-ref option was implemented just five days ago,
    hopefully no one is yet depending on it so that this change won't affect
    anybody. Hence, I'm not bumping the package major version as the
    Semantic Versioning scheme would advise.

1.11.1    2015-09-22 10:19:40-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - Git::More::blob now throws exceptions on errors instead of injecting the
    messages with Git::More::error. This makes it suitable for use by user
    hooks.

1.11.0    2015-09-22 09:45:26-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - CheckCommit: Add option checkcommit.check-ref to allow one to specify
    Perl code to check commits during a git push.

1.10.0    2015-07-04 15:13:40-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - CheckFile: Implement new directives to check files by comparing their
    names with regular expressions.

  [Changes]

  - Git::Hooks's homepage now is the GitHub Page
    http://gnustavo.github.io/Git-Hooks/.

1.9.0     2015-05-27 21:28:52-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - DROP SUPPORT FOR GITS OLDER THAN VERSION 1.7.2 !!!
    Previously Git::Hooks supported Gits since version 1.6.0.

  [Fixes]

  - Git::More: the methods filter_files_in_* no longer return submodule
    paths when they change, since most plugins assume they can apply
    git-cat-file and other Git commands on the paths returned, but they fail
    on submodule paths.

1.8.1     2015-05-22 20:22:09-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - CheckCommit: The checkcommit.canonical option requires the
    git-check-mailmap command which is available since Git 1.8.4. Older Gits
    don't have it and Git::Hooks now detects this and explains the problem
    to the user instead of simply die.

1.8.0     2015-05-21 21:23:17-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - CheckCommit: Add new plugin Git::Hooks::CheckCommit which checks commit
    information such as author and committer names and emails and commit
    signatures.

  - CheckJira: New functionality to insert a comment about the commit on the
    JIRA issue during the post-rewrite hook.

  - CheckLog: Add option checklog.ref to restrict the references on which
    the checks must be performed, making it equivalent to the checkjira.ref
    option.

  - Add support for the push-to-checkout hook, new as of Git 2.4.0.

  [Changes]

  - The changes implemented on version 1.7.0 in the function
    Git::More::get_commit were reverted because they imposed a performance
    penalty on every call, even though most of them wouldn't use the new
    information about commit signatures.

  - Skip checks for users configured as githooks.admin on Gerrit's
    patchset-created hook.

  [Fixes]

  - CheckJira: Use checkjira.ref option in the patchset-created hook too.

  [Thanks]

  Kudos to Mikko Koivunalho who provided code and ideas for most of the new
  features in this release.

1.7.1     2015-04-26 22:59:18-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - CheckLog: the body-max-width configuration don't check the size of
    indented lines in the commit messages since they're normally used for
    quotation or by Git itself to list, for example, the files conflicted on
    a merge.

  - Show some Git errors during the test suite which were being suppressed.

1.7.0     2015-04-22 22:39:32-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - CheckFile: New githooks.checkfile.size option imposes a limit to the
    maximum size of files added to the repository.

  - New function Git::More::get_sha1 returns the SHA1 associated with a
    revision expression.

  - Git::More::get_commit(s) functions return information about commit
    signatures.

  [Changes]

  - CheckLog plugin error messages now show the full SHA1 of commits instead
    of a 7-letter prefix to avoid potential ambiguities.

  [Fixes]

  - CheckLog: The githooks.checklog.title-required option when false was
    disabling all other title checks.

  - Git::More::get_commit(s) functions now UTF-8 encode its results.

  - Git::More::get_commit(s) functions were returning a hash with the wrong
    key 'commmitter_name'.

  [Internal changes]

  - Git::More::get_commit(s) functions now cache results avoiding repeated
    invocations of git-rev-list for different plugins.

1.6.12    2015-04-12 21:46:50-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - CheckJira: The by-assignee test was failing for tickets with no
    assignees.

  - Git::More::get_commit was returning the commit's message with a trailing
    "\c@\cJ" mark.

  - Git::More::get_commit now guarantees that the commit message is UTF-8
    encoded.

1.6.11    2015-03-22 22:19:06-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Internal changes]

  - Make the module Gerrit::REST a recommendation instead of a requirement
    since it's only needed when one want's to use Gerrit hooks.

  - Remove the README.3 and TODO.3 manpages from the distribution.

1.6.10    2015-03-14 19:33:16-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Do not install README.pod anymore since it's not useful after
    installation and when installed it ends up as Git::README instead of
    Git::Hooks::README. Many thanks to Karen Etheridge who kindly explained
    the problem to me.
    [https://github.com/gnustavo/Git-Hooks/issues/10]

  - Make JIRA::REST and Text::SpellChecker distribution recommendations
    instead of requirements. Text::SpellChecker has some installation
    problems in some platforms. Both are needed only for specific plugins
    which not every user may need.
    [https://github.com/gnustavo/Git-Hooks/issues/14]

1.6.9     2015-02-20 16:47:44-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Use unanbiguous Gerrit change-ids.

1.6.8     2015-02-17 19:42:38-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Internal changes]

  - Clean up module prerequisite list in dist.ini.

  - Use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaProvide to insert provides into META.yml.

  - Move TUTORIAL.pod and TODO.pod into lib/Git/Hooks directory so that they
    can be read as 'perldoc Git/Hooks/TUTORIAL'.

  - Replace README/INSTALL with brian d foy's README.pod template.

  - Update documentation.

1.6.7     2015-02-15 19:38:29-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Fix the t/02-gerrit-change-it.t test so that it does not depend on the
    locale.

1.6.6     2015-02-14 02:45:32-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Fix a some error detection in CheckJira.

1.6.5     2015-02-01 21:11:46-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Now I'm sure those pesky tests have been fixed for good!

1.6.4     2015-02-01 16:57:10-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Fix still more tests that break on brand new repositories.

1.6.3     2015-02-01 11:30:27-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - GerritChangeId was broken for commit with empty messages.

1.6.2     2015-01-20 17:13:24-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Git::More::filter_files_in_range was broken for ranges where the
    old-commit was undefined.

1.6.1     2015-01-07 11:55:44 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Fix Git::More::get_affected_ref_commit_ids for newly created refs.  When
    a new ref is pushed it's old commit is represented by the null id
    ('0'x40'), which the git-rev-list command doesn't like. So, instead of
    invoking git-rev-list directly, get_affected_ref_commit_ids invokes
    get_affected_ref_commits which already knows how to deal with these edge
    cases. Moreover, get_affected_ref_commits caches the results of
    git-rev-list, making it possible to reuse it in different hooks.

1.6.0     2015-01-04 16:57:32 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - The new method Git::More::blob replaces the routine
    Git::Hooks::file_temp which is now deprecated.

  [Fixes]

  - Contrary to what the documentation said, the Git::Hooks::file_temp
    routine always returned a string containing the temporary file name
    where the blob was written to, not a File::Temp object.

  - The documentation doesn't mention any more the deprecated option
    variables githooks.checkacls.userenv, githooks.checkacls.admin,
    githooks.checkjira.userenv, and githooks.checkjira.admin, which weren't
    supported for a long time.

  [Internal changes]

  - All uses of the modules File::Slurp, File::Spec, and File::Path were
    changed to use module Path::Tiny instead. This refactoring was inspired
    by Matt S. Trout's module review at
    http://shadow.cat/blog/matt-s-trout/mstpan-5/.

1.5.0     2014-12-22 22:49:24 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - New plugin CheckWhitespace to detect whitespace errors in files.

  - New routine Git::More::get_head_or_empty_tree returns the SHA1
    representing the empty tree when HEAD is undefined, which happens in a
    brand new repository.

  [Fixes]

  - Fix Git::More::filter_files_in_index to work in brand new repositories.

1.4.0     2014-12-16 21:06:16 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - The new options 'githooks.help-on-error' (global) and
    'githooks.PLUGIN.help-on-error' (local) allows one to provide helpful
    messages to the users in case of errors.

  [Changes]

  - The temporary files created by Git::Hooks::file_temp to dump the
    contents of <path> at <commit> are now constructed as
    <File::Temp::newdir>/<commit>/<path> so that they end with <path>. Some
    file checkers, e.g. PerlCritic and Python Lint, that are invoked by
    Git::Hooks::CheckFile complain if the filename doesn't match the name of
    the package/module defined in it.
    
    Moreover, the contents of all temporary files are cached so that they
    can be reused, possibly by different Git::Hooks plugins. The temporary
    directory is removed with all of its contents when the hook exits.

  - Require File::pushd to run tests.

  - Drop dependency on File::Basename.

1.3.0     2014-10-25 19:22:42 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - The global variable $Git::More::CONFIG_ENCODING tells get_config which
    encoding is used in Git's configuration files so that it can decode them
    appropriately. This is necessary if your config files contain non-ASCII
    characters.

  [Changes]

  - CheckFile: replace temporary filenames with the real filenames in the
    error messages to make it consistent with the command line shown.

  - CheckJira: re-order the checks so that it goes from the more general to
    the more specific, e.g.: issuetype > status > unresolved.

  - CheckJira: tell the user which issuetypes and statuses are approved when
    an issue doesn't pass a check.

  [Fixes]

  - Normalize branch names gotten from Gerrit so that we can properly detect
    which branches have been affected by git pushes.

1.2.1     2014-10-17 15:47:34 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - CheckJira: interpolate $+ into regexp fixversions too.

  - CheckFile: fix patchset-created hook.

  - Fix locale setting during tests.

1.2.0     2014-10-16 12:03:32 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - CheckJira: implement option githooks.checkjira.status.

  - CheckJira: implement option githooks.checkjira.issuetype.

  - CheckJira: implement option githooks.checkjira.fixversion.

1.1.0     2014-10-13 13:23:37 America/Sao_Paulo (TRIAL RELEASE)

  [Changes]

  - Use the CPAN distribution of the Git module instead of the Git.pm that
  comes with the git package. This makes Git::Hooks properly dependent of
  Git, which also means that the GITPERLLIB environment variable isn't
  needed anymore. (Many thanks to Mike South for taking care of the Git
  module maintenance.)

1.0.2     2014-10-02 08:52:36 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - (PR#5) Remove the need to use File::Slurp in Makefile.PL.

1.0.1     2014-09-21 20:07:44 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - (RT-99019) Fix warning about precedence issues.

1.0.0     2014-09-20 16:59:47 America/Sao_Paulo

  The jump to version 1.0.0 signify the module is considered mature. It's
  being used now by at least two large enterprises and no big incompatible
  change is predicted in the near future. We'll try to adhere to the
  Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/) specification from non on.

  [New features]

  - The githooks.group option is now treated as a multi-valued option,
    allowing one to specify groups with more than one definition.

  [Documentation]

  - The TUTORIAL was revised and improved, with new sections for Git server
    and Gerrit adminitrators.

0.052     2014-09-18 21:41:12 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New Features]

  - New plugin Git::Hooks::CheckFile checks the contents of files with
    external commands. Which command is used to check a file is based on the
    filename.

  [Changes]

  - Drop configuration backwards compatibility. Up to version 0.31, as of
    January 2013, there were some changes in the way Git::Hooks and its
    plugins were configured. Up to version 0.051 those old ways were still
    supported. This version drops that compatibility baggage.

  - CheckLog now shows which lines are bigger than body-max-width in the
    error message.

  [Fixes]

  - The output of external hooks that fail are now sent to Gerrit as a
    comment.

  - CheckLog was complaining about lines with exactly body-max-width
    characters. Now it lets them pass.

0.051     2014-09-13 15:13:44 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - Complain if $ENV{HOME} is undefined because this means $HOME/.gitconfig
    isn't grokked. If you really don't want to grok it, define $HOME as the
    empty string.

  [Fixes]

  - Fix merge commit checks in CheckLog and CheckJira.

  - Fix argument passing to Gerrit external hooks.

0.050     2014-08-31 08:17:29 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - CheckJira's githooks.checkjira.project option is now strict, i.e., when
    it's set specifying a set of JIRA projects only those project's issues
    may be refered to in the commit messages. Other project's issues are
    rejected. Previously, other project's issues were accepted without any
    other check.

  - Make error messages more uniform.

0.049     2014-08-16 20:47:21 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - Support Gerrit's draft-published hook which is invoked when a draft
    change is published.

  - New githooks.nocarp configuration variable to suppress the script line
    number on error messages.

  - New githooks.gerrit.comment-ok configuration variable to add a comment
    to a positive review in Gerrit.

  - All error messages are now printed in a specific format.

  - Released at #cpanday.

  [Fixes]

  - Git configuration variables can't have underscores in their names. So,
    this version changes the names of three of them under the
    githooks.gerrit section: review_label, vote_ok, and vote_nok. They are
    now: review-label, vote-ok, and vote-nok.

  - The patchset-created hook wasn't setting up the configuration variables
    correctly.

  - Draft changes in Gerrit don't trigger the patchset-created hook anymore,
    because only the draft owner can review it.

0.048     2014-08-05 14:05:28 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]
  - CheckJira now uses the JIRA::REST module instead of JIRA::Client.  The
    JIRA::Client module uses JIRA's SOAP API which was deprecated on JIRA
    6.0 and won't be available anymore on JIRA 7.0. Note that this may break
    user code relying on the JIRA::Client objects, which isn't needed for
    the hook's basic functionality.

  [Fixes]

  - Suppress spurious error message (fatal: ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref)
  when pushing a commit while in a detached head state.

0.047     2014-01-29 12:21:18 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]
  - Remove suggestion to undo a commit when a problem is detected in
    the post-commit hook. Now we only suggest to amend it.

  - Make githooks.plugin configuration variable accept a list of
    plugins names.

  [Fixes]
  - Fix handling of fully qualified module names for plugins.

  - Fix CheckJira's commit-msg error message which was incorrectly
    showing a commit SHA-1 as '0000000'.

0.046     2013-06-30 17:01:46 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]
  - New githooks.abort-commit config option to modify the behavior of
    the pre-commit and the commit-msg hooks when they die.

  [Changes]
  - Renamed doc/user-tutorial.pod to TUTORIAL.pod. The document is a
    little improved.

  - Require at least git v1.6.0 (released on 2008-08-17) to avoid a
    problem in older Git modules. Previously we were requiring at
    least git v1.5.0, which was released on 2007-02-14.

0.045     2013-06-27 17:22:18 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]
  - Refactor Git::More::read_commit_msg_file to avoid using
    Git::command_bidi_pipe which seems to not work on FreeBSD.

0.044     2013-06-27 09:13:28 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]
  - Version 0.043 used the s///r operator, which was implemented on
    Perl 5.14. This version refactors it to avoid the operator and
    keep compatibility with Perl 5.10.

0.043     2013-06-26 10:35:02 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]
  - Support the new pre-push hook, implemented by Git 1.8.2 which is
    invoked during a "git push" command.
    
  - New class Git::More::Message, representing a Git commit
    message. Generally speaking, a commit message can be any string
    whatsoever. However, the Git community came up with a few
    conventions for how to best format a message and this class
    embraces those conventions making it easier for you to validate
    and change a commit message structure. With it the
    Git::Hooks::CheckLog and Git::Hooks::GerritChangeId plugins were
    much simplified.
  
  - New method Git::More::read_commit_msg_file that reads the contents
    of a file, respecting the i18n.commitencoding config option, and
    returns its contents stripspaced.
  
  - New method Git::More::write_commit_msg_file that writes a string
    to a file respecting the i18n.commitencoding config option.

  - New methods Git::More::push_input_data and
    Git::More::get_input_data to unify the treatment of data read from
    STDIN by the hooks pre-receive, post-receive, pre-push, and
    post-rewrite.

  [Fixes]
  - The data passed to the post-rewrite hook via STDIN wasn't being
    processed.

0.042     2013-05-31 15:17:39 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]
  - CheckJira: Make githooks.checkjira.matchlog option be
    multi-valued. This allows one to specify more than one place in
    the commit message where JIRA keys are looked for.

  - Add a User Tutorial document.

  [Fixes]
  - Make tests independent of git's global init.templatedir option.

0.041     2013-05-25 11:46:39 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]
  - Support Gerrit's ref-update and patchset-created hooks. Gerrit
    (http://gerrit.googlecode.com/) is a web-based code review system
    which incorporates a Git server implemented with JGit
    (http://www.eclipse.org/jgit/), which is a pure Java
    implementation of Git.  Up to version 2.2.0 JGit still doesn't
    support Git standard hooks. However, Gerrit implements its own
    special hooks
    (http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.6/
    config-hooks.html), which are rather different from Git's.

  - New option: githooks.disable. This option can be used to disable
    plugins otherwise enabled by the githooks.plugin option. It's
    useful if you want to enable a plugin globally and only disable it
    for some repositories.

  [Fixes]
  - CheckRewrite: Detect and allow fast-forward "git rebase upstream
    base". If upstream is a decendant of base, the base-commit is
    empty. In this situation the rebase will turn out to be a simple
    fast-forward merge from base on upstream and there is nothing to
    lose.

  - Fix plugin disabling detection. Plugins enabled in the
    configuration using their full module name could not be disabled
    via the environment variable trick, because the variable must have
    the full plugin name, but ':' characters are not accepted in
    environment variable names.

  - Fix BAIL_OUT message during tests.

0.040     2013-03-15 00:21:24 America/Sao_Paulo

  The 0.039 release package contained some experimental code
  unintentionally. This new release simply fix this. The changes
  recorded below for the 0.039 release are still valid.

0.039     2013-03-14 23:56:15 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]
  - run_hook doesn't die at the first error anymore. Now it collects
    errors from all hooks to be able to show them all when it dies at
    the end. These modification required changes to all plugins to
    make them invoke an error method instead of simply dying.

  [Changes]
  - Git::More::get_current_branch previously returned the branch
    short-name. Now it returns the branch full name. Moreover, when in
    detached mode it returns undef.

  [Fixes]
  - The exit code of external pre-receive hooks weren't being dealt
    with correctly.

  - The arguments for update and pre-receive hooks weren't being dealt
    with correctly when new branches were being pushed or branches
    were being deteled on a push.

  - Fix Git::More::is_ref_enabled for when in detached head state. It
    returns true in this case.

  [Cleanup]
  - Fix all L<> POD tags in the documentation.

0.038     2013-02-01 16:25:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Updates]
  - Remove "beta status" warning from README.

  [Fixes]
  - The dzil configuration now correctly detects build-time
    dependencies.

  - The testing framework now produces some more intelligent error
    messages.

0.037     2013-01-29 22:14:25 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]
  - Makefile.PL now tries to find Git.pm on some usual places if it
    can't require it using the standard @INC. This allows for
    installation and testing on systems where Git cannot be required
    directly.

  - GerritChangeId wasn't calculating the Change-Id correctly in some
    cases.

  [Fixes]
  - CheckRewrite wasn't showing the names reaching branch names
    correctly.

  [Refactorings for a future port to Windows (We're not there yet!)]
  - The testing framework now uses Git::command to invoke git instead
    of using directly an open pipe.

  - Git::More used Git::command_output_pipe in a way that wasn't
    working on Windows.

  - External hooks won't be supported on Windows for a while. Hence,
    some tests are skipped.

  - The testing framework uses sh-scripts to indirectly invoke the
    Perl hooks on Windows, because that OS does not follow the
    shee-bang Unix conventions.

  - Several other small changes.

0.036     2013-01-19 16:41:16 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Interface changes]
  - Internal hooks now shouldn't die directly when they detect a
    problem. Instead, they should invoke the new Git::More::error
    method to produce the error message and return a boolean value
    indicating if they have succeeded. This way they don't need to
    stop at the first error, but can detect many more and generate
    more information to the user.

    In order to support old hooks, run_hooks checks their return
    values. If they return a boolean, they're treated as modern
    hooks. If they return undef (and $@ is empty, so that it wasn't an
    exception) they are considered to have succeeded.
    
  [New]
  - Git::Hooks::run_hooks only dies after having run every internal
    and external hooks and seeing that not every one of them
    succeeded. This way the user gets informed of every problem and
    not just the first one found.

  - Add method Git::More::error to be used by plugins to produce
    consistent error and warning messages to the user.

  - Add method Git::More::clean_cache to delete a cache entry. It may
    be used by hooks just before returning to Git::Hooks::run_hooks in
    order to get rid of any value kept in the SECTION's entry.

  [Fix]
  - CheckLog did not treat empty commit messages correctly.

0.035     2013-01-18 08:44:20 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New]
  - Provide for temporary disabling of plugins by setting to a false
    value (e.g. '0') an environment variable named after the
    plugin. This is useful for temporary disabling of pre-commit
    hooks, for instance.

  - Add method Git::More::set_authenticated_user
    
    This method can be used to set the username of the authenticated user
    when the default heristics used by the method authenticated_user
    aren't enough. The name is cached so that subsequent invokations of
    authenticated_user will return it.

  [Fix]
  - CheckRewrite was invoking 'git branch --all' but old versions of
    git didn't support the long option name. Now it uses '-a' instead.

  - CheckRewrite error messages showed branch names with two character
    prefix.

  [Cleanup]
  - Make the Change file conform to the Specification for CPAN Changes
    files (CPAN::Changes::Spec).

0.034	  2013-01-16 12:22:37 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New]
  - Implement the new Git::Hooks::CheckRewrite plugin to check the
    safety of rewrites, by detecting when we're amending or rebasing
    commits that have already been pushed.

0.033	  2013-01-12 18:45:07 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Incompatible changes]
  - Substitute Git for App::gh::Git as a parent for Git::More. The
    major motivation for this was to get rid of some heavy
    dependencies that were carried over by App::gh. This change should
    be mostly transparent, as App::gh::Git is a copy of Git.

    Since Git isn't on CPAN we can't depend directly on it. The user
    must guarantee that it is present on @INC in order to install and
    use Git::Hooks. The environment variable GITPERLLIB can be used to
    specify a list of directories (besides the ones already in @INC)
    where the module will be searched.

  - Consolidate the methods Git::More::get_config and
    Git::More::config in a single method Git::More::get_config, which
    returns ever more specialized configuration depending on how many
    arguments it gets (zero, one, or two). This change affects most
    plugins.

  [Fix]
  - Make a change in the way we inkoke "git init" during test so that
    we can use pre-v1.6.5 gits.

0.032	  2013-01-06 10:06:48 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Incompatible change]
  - Simplify plugin/hook integration. Previously, if a plugin could be
    hooked to more than one hook, one should configure all the
    integrations by hand. For instance, the CheckJira plugin can be
    hooked to the update, the pre-receive, and the commit-msg hooks,
    and the user had to know which hooks should be enabled. Now it's
    easier because the plugins can hook themselves to all hooks
    directly. In this way, for instance, instead of configuring
    CheckJira specifically for one of those hooks with one of the
    following configurations:

        git config --add githooks.commig-msg  CheckJira
        git config --add githooks.pre-receive CheckJira
        git config --add githooks.update      CheckJira

    One can simply do this:

        git config --add githooks.plugin CheckJira

    CheckJira will automatically be enabled for all plugins.

    Also, the plugins can be referred to by their fully qualified
    module names (e.g. Git::Hooks::CheckJira) to allow for third party
    plugins.

    If the githooks.plugin option is not defined, the configuration
    processing will try to build it from the old githooks.HOOK
    configuration options that are not needed anymore, so to preserve
    compatibility. This is a temporary measure.

0.031	  2013-01-05 23:33:50 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Incompatible changes]
  - Move plugin config options to a githooks subsection. For example,
    the CheckLog.spelling option now is called
    githooks.checklog.spelling. The new scheme avoids unecessary
    pollution of the configuration namespace. The plugins that existed
    up to the previous release can still have their options in the
    previous place, because we dynamically move them. This is a
    temporary measure to avoid breaking old configuration. It will
    probably be removed in the future.

  [Cleanup]
  - Rename TODO to TODO.pod and update it with new ideas.

0.030	  2012-12-29 23:06:08 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]
  - Fix two bugs. No new features.

0.029	  2012-12-26 23:12:17 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fix]
  - Fix test t/02-check-log.t requirement of Text::SpellChecker.

  - Recommends Text::SpellChecker instead of requiring it, as it's
    only needed for the Git::Hooks::CheckLog plugin.

  [Cleanup]
  - Update TODO file.

0.028	  2012-12-25 22:47:34 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New]
  - CheckLog implements spell checking of log messages.

  [Fix]
  - Abort building on Windows. We're not ready yet.

  - Git::More::get_commit_msg now supports pre-1.7.2 Gits.

0.026	  2012-12-22 20:23:22 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New]
  - Implement a new plugin Git::Hooks::CheckLog to enforce formatting
    policies for git commit log messages.

  [Fix]
  - Fix configuration grokking.

  - Recommends JIRA::Client instead of requiring it, as it is only
    needed for the Git::Hooks::CheckJira plugin.

0.025	  2012-12-21 08:06:04 America/Sao_Paulo

  - This version is another big refactoring. It introduces a few
    incompatible changes as well, for good measure. ;-)

  [Incompatible Changes Affecting Plugin Users]
  - The CheckJira.by-assignee option previously required the name of
    an environment variable. But this was duplicating poorly the
    functionality of the githooks.userenv global option. So, I changed
    its meaning to now require a boolean (integer). If true it now
    checks if the authenticated_user (as inferred by the
    githooks.userenv option) is the current issue's assignee.

  [Incompatible Changes Affecting Plugin Developers]
  - The Git::Hooks routines grok_affected_refs, get_affected_refs,
    get_affected_ref_range, get_affected_ref_commit_ids, and
    get_affected_ref_commits were transformed in Git::More methods, so
    that they can now keep the affected_refs information inside the
    objects.

  - The Git::Hooks::grok_userenv routine was transformed into the
    Git::More::authenticated_user method.

  - The Git::Hooks::git_config routine was transformed into the
    Git::More::config method.

  - The method Git::More::get_commits now returns a list of commits
    and not an array-ref. This makes its usage simpler.

  [Fixes]
  - The tests are now performed out of the distribution directory.  By
    performing them in the distribution directory we run the risk of
    messing up with Git::Hooks own git repository, which can interfere
    with the tests too.

  [Refactorings]
  - Got rid of global variables in Git::Hooks and all state variables
    used throughout. This had a great impact in the code, adding
    arguments to several routines, turning Git::Hooks routines into
    Git::More methods, adding new methods

  - The tests now prepare only the hooks that will be tested. Earlier
    we prepared all 16 hooks, which made the testing take longer.

  - The compatibility with old plugin names that was implemented some
    commits ago was made more specific, affecting just the plugins
    CheckAcls, CheckJira, and CheckStructure. Those were the plugins
    that existed before the plugin name change.

0.024	  2012-12-17 12:35:52 America/Sao_Paulo

  - Implement a new plugin Git::Hooks::GerritChangeId which is a
    reimplementation of Gerrit's commit-msg official one
    (http://tinyurl.com/cglobb4, at Gerrit's v2.5.1).

  - Improve code and documentation with the help of Code::TidyAll,
    Perl::Critic, Pod::Checker, and Pod::Spell.

0.023	  2012-12-16 08:47:55 America/Sao_Paulo

  - This version makes a large refactor in the code. The plugins were
    rewritten as proper modules so that they can be used by
    themselves, without the Git::Hooks framework. The only user
    visible change is that from now on the preferred way to configure
    plugins is by their CamelCase names (e.g. CheckJira instead of
    check-jira). But the old flattened names are still valid to keep
    compatibility with already set up repos.

  - This version starts to require App::gh::Git version 0.56 in order
    to have a working App::gh::Git. It also starts to require
    File::Path version 2.08 for the testing phase in order to have a
    working make_path routine.

  - Implement a new plugin called check-structure.pl which enforces
    the repository's file and reference structure.

0.021	  2012-12-06 08:52:34 America/Sao_Paulo

  - The configuration variables userenv and admin, which were
    available in the check-acls and check-jira plugins were promoted
    to the "githooks" configuration section. Along with them, the
    functions grok_userenv, match_user, and im_admin were also
    migrated to the Git::Hooks module so that they can be used by any
    access control plugin.  The old configuration variables in the
    plugins are still supported but are now documented as deprecated.

  - Also improved the documentation slightly.

  - Implement routine Git::Hooks::eval_gitconfig to make it easier to
    grok Perl expressions in config values.

  - Fix some problems in the test infrastructure.

  - Fix the post-receive hook which now gets the same input as
    pre-receive. This was reported to me by Mike South. Thanks again!

0.018	  2012-11-06 21:49:20 America/Sao_Paulo

  - Fix a bug that prevented installed hooks to be invoked in the
    absence of any configured plugins. This was reported to me by Mike
    South. Thanks!

0.017	  2012-10-31 10:45:10 America/Sao_Paulo

  - Just a bunch of fixes.

0.016	  2012-09-13 22:34:05 America/Sao_Paulo

  - Interpolate environment variables in the whole ACL specification
    for check-acls.

  - Make the .pl extension optional in configuring plugins.

  - Make im_memberof an exported routine of Git::Hooks.

  - The group specification is now given by the githooks.groups
    variable. This is an incompatible change, since previously it was
    given by the check-acls.groups variable.

  - Implement Git::More::get_affected_files. This routine returns a
    hash mapping every affected file in a sequence of commits to a
    letter telling its affected status.

  - Allow check-acls.userenv be given by a code snippet to be
    evaluated.

0.015	  2012-08-19 18:20:07 America/Sao_Paulo

  - ACLs in check-acls.pl can have environment variables interpolated
    in their refs components.

  - Implement reference specification by negated regexes in ACLs.

  - Clarify semantics of ACLs what component in the documentation.

  - Fix check-jira.matchlog usage.

  - Provide different messages when there are JIRAs cited but not from
    an expected project.

  - Improve testing framework.

0.010	  2012-07-23 11:25:09 America/Sao_Paulo

  - Check if we have git installed before generating Makefile from
    Makefile.PL so that we avoid producing bogus cpantesters.org
    reports.

0.009	  2012-07-22 11:21:18 America/Sao_Paulo

  - Show git version upon test failure.

0.008	  2012-07-20 17:19:17 America/Sao_Paulo

  - Fix check-acls.pl to detect ref rewrites to non-related commits.

0.007	  2012-07-17 08:59:31 America/Sao_Paulo

  - Fix still more errors detected by
    http://cpantesters.org/distro/G/Git-Hooks.html.

0.006	  2012-07-16 17:29:12 America/Sao_Paulo

  - Enable pre 1.7.2 gits by using old-fashioned rev-list --pretty
    formats.

  - Fix dependency on App::gh::Git.

0.002	   2012-07-11 America/Sao_Paulo

  - Implement support for driving external hooks.

  - Rename option githooks.hookdir to githooks.plugins.

  - Rename default local plugin directory from .git/hooks.d to
    .git/githooks.

  - Add option githooks.externals to disable external hooks processing.

  - Add option githooks.hooks to specify extra directories to look for
    external hooks.

0.001	   2012-07-10 America/Sao_Paulo

  - First release, with two hooks passing tests: check-acls.pl and
    check-jira.pl.

  - I decided to incorporate Git::More in this distribution instead of
    making it a separate module.

  - The documentation is lacking and the functionality needs to be
    expanded.
