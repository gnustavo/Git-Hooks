{{$NEXT}}

0.024     2012-12-17 12:35:52 America/Sao_Paulo

        Implement a new plugin Git::Hooks::GerritChangeId which is a
        reimplementation of Gerrit's commit-msg official one
        (http://tinyurl.com/cglobb4, at Gerrit's v2.5.1).

        Improve code and documentation with the help of Code::TidyAll,
        Perl::Critic, Pod::Checker, and Pod::Spell.

	This version makes a large refactor in the code. The plugins
	were rewritten as proper modules so that they can be used by
	themselves, without the Git::Hooks framework. The only user
	visible change is that from now on the preferred way to
	configure plugins is by their CamelCase names (e.g. CheckJira
	instead of check-jira). But the old flattened names are still
	valid to keep compatibility with already set up repos.

	This version starts to require App::gh::Git version 0.56 in
	order to have a working App::gh::Git. It also starts to
	require File::Path version 2.08 for the testing phase in order
	to have a working make_path routine.

0.022     2012-12-06 23:13:44 America/Sao_Paulo

	Implement a new plugin called check-structure.pl which
	enforces the repository's file and reference structure.

0.021     2012-12-06 08:52:34 America/Sao_Paulo

	The configuration variables userenv and admin, which were
	available in the check-acls and check-jira plugins were
	promoted to the "githooks" configuration section. Along with
	them, the functions grok_userenv, match_user, and im_admin
	were also migrated to the Git::Hooks module so that they can
	be used by any access control plugin.  The old configuration
	variables in the plugins are still supported but are now
	documented as deprecated.

	Also improved the documentation slightly.

0.020     2012-11-20 21:56:51 America/Sao_Paulo

	Implement routine Git::Hooks::eval_gitconfig to make it easier
	to grok Perl expressions in config values.

	Fix some problems in the test infrastructure.

0.019     2012-11-10 23:56:44 America/Sao_Paulo

	Fix the post-receive hook which now gets the same input as
	pre-receive. This was reported to me by Mike South. Thanks
	again!

0.018     2012-11-06 21:49:20 America/Sao_Paulo

	Fix a bug that prevented installed hooks to be invoked in the
	absense of any configured plugins. This was reported to me by
	Mike South. Thanks!

0.017     2012-10-31 10:45:10 America/Sao_Paulo

	Just a bunch of fixes.

0.016     2012-09-13 22:34:05 America/Sao_Paulo

	Interpolate environment variables in the whole ACL
	specification for check-acls.

	Make the .pl extension optional in configuring plugins.

	Make im_memberof an exported routine of Git::Hooks.

	The group specification is now given by the githooks.groups
	variable. This is an incompatible change, since previously it
	was given by the check-acls.groups variable.

	Implement Git::More::get_affected_files. This routine returns
	a hash mapping every affected file in a sequence of commits to
	a letter telling its affected status.

	Allow check-acls.userenv be given by a code snippet to be
	evaluated.

0.015     2012-08-19 18:20:07 America/Sao_Paulo

	ACLs in check-acls.pl can have environment variables
	interpolated in their refs components.

0.014     2012-08-16 23:00:38 America/Sao_Paulo

	Implement reference specification by negated regexes in ACLs.

	Clarify semantics of ACLs what component in the documentation.

	Fix check-jira.matchlog usage.

	Provide different messages when there are JIRAs cited but not
	from an expected project.

0.013     2012-07-27 17:11:17 America/Sao_Paulo

	Require at least git 1.5 to work with.

0.012     2012-07-26 12:11:10 America/Sao_Paulo

	Improve testing framework.

0.011     2012-07-25 11:12:01 America/Sao_Paulo

	Improve testing framework.

0.010     2012-07-23 11:25:09 America/Sao_Paulo

	Check if we have git installed before generating Makefile from
	Makefile.PL so that we avoid producing bogus cpantesters.org
	reports.

0.009     2012-07-22 11:21:18 America/Sao_Paulo

	Show git version upon test failure.

0.008     2012-07-20 17:19:17 America/Sao_Paulo

	Fix check-acls.pl to detect ref rewrites to non-related
	commits.

0.007     2012-07-17 08:59:31 America/Sao_Paulo

	Fix still more errors detected by
	http://cpantesters.org/distro/G/Git-Hooks.html.

0.006     2012-07-16 17:29:12 America/Sao_Paulo

	Enable pre 1.7.2 gits by using old-fashioned rev-list --pretty
	formats.

0.005     2012-07-16 10:17:16 America/Sao_Paulo

	Fix some errors detected by
	http://cpantesters.org/distro/G/Git-Hooks.html.

0.004     2012-07-15 22:01:36 America/Sao_Paulo

	Fix missing required dependency.

0.003     2012-07-15 18:33:20 America/Sao_Paulo

	Fix dependency on App::gh::Git.

0.002      2012-07-11 America/Sao_Paulo

	Implement support for driving external hooks.

	Rename option githooks.hookdir to githooks.plugins.

	Rename default local plugin directory from .git/hooks.d to
	.git/githooks.

	Add option githooks.externals to disable external hooks processing.

	Add option githooks.hooks to specify extra directories to look for
	external hooks.

0.001      2012-07-10 America/Sao_Paulo

	First release, with two hooks passing tests: check-acls.pl and
	check-jira.pl.

	I decided to incorporate Git::More in this distribution instead of
	making it a separate module.

	The documentation is lacking and the functionality needs to be
	expanded.
