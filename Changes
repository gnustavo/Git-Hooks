Revision history for Git-Hooks. -*- text -*-

{{$NEXT}}

        Implement the new Git::Hooks::SafeRewrite plugin to check the
        safety of rewrites, by detecting when we're amending or
        rebasing commits that have already been pushed.

        Substitute Git for App::gh::Git as a parent for Git::More. The
        major motivation for this was to get rid of some heavy
        dependencies that were carried over by App::gh. This change
        should be mostly transparent, as App::gh::Git is a copy of
        Git.

        Since Git isn't on CPAN we can't depend directly on it. The
        user must guarantee that it is present on @INC in order to
        install and use Git::Hooks. The environment variable
        GITPERLLIB can be used to specify a list of directories
        (besides the ones already in @INC) where the module will be
        searched.

        Consolidate the methods Git::More::get_config and
        Git::More::config in a single method Git::More::get_config,
        which returns ever more specialized configuration depending on
        how many arguments it gets (zero, one, or two). This change
        affects most plugins.

        Make a change in the way we inkoke "git init" during test so
        that we can use pre-v1.6.5 gits.

	Simplify plugin/hook integration

	Previously, if a plugin could be hooked to more than one hook,
	one should configure all the integrations by hand. For
	instance, the CheckJira plugin can be hooked to the update,
	the pre-receive, and the commit-msg hooks, and the user had to
	know which hooks should be enabled. Now it's easier because
	the plugins can hook themselves to all hooks directly. In this
	way, for instance, instead of configuring CheckJira
	specifically for one of those hooks with one of the following
	configurations:

	    git config --add githooks.commig-msg  CheckJira
	    git config --add githooks.pre-receive CheckJira
	    git config --add githooks.update      CheckJira

	One can simply do this:

	    git config --add githooks.plugin CheckJira

	CheckJira will automatically be enabled for all plugins.

	Also, the plugins can be referred to by their fully qualified
	module names (e.g. Git::Hooks::CheckJira) to allow for third
	party plugins.

	If the githooks.plugin option is not defined, the
	configuration processing will try to build it from the old
	githooks.HOOK configuration options that are not needed
	anymore, so to preserve compatibility. This is a temporary
	measure.

0.031     2013-01-05 23:33:50 America/Sao_Paulo

        Move plugin config options to a githooks subsection. For
        example, the CheckLog.spelling option now is called
        githooks.checklog.spelling. The new scheme avoids unecessary
        pollution of the configuration namespace. The plugins that
        existed up to the previous release can still have their
        options in the previous place, because we dynamically move
        them. This is a temporary measure to avoid breaking old
        configuration. It will probably be removed in the future.

        Rename TODO to TODO.pod and update it with new ideas.

0.029     2012-12-26 23:12:17 America/Sao_Paulo

        Fix test t/02-check-log.t requirement of Text::SpellChecker.

        Recommends Text::SpellChecker instead of requiring it, as it's
        only needed for the Git::Hooks::CheckLog plugin.

        Update TODO file.

        formatting policies for git commit log messages.

        Fix configuration grokking.

        Recommends JIRA::Client instead of requiring it, as it is only
        needed for the Git::Hooks::CheckJira plugin.

        This version is another big refactoring. It introduces a few
        incompatible changes as well, for good measure. ;-)

        * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES AFFECTING PLUGIN USERS:

        The CheckJira.by-assignee option previously required the name
        of an environment variable. But this was duplicating poorly
        the functionality of the githooks.userenv global option. So, I
        changed its meaning to now require a boolean (integer). If
        true it now checks if the authenticated_user (as inferred by
        the githooks.userenv option) is the current issue's assignee.

        * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES AFFECTING PLUGIN DEVELOPERS:

        The Git::Hooks routines grok_affected_refs, get_affected_refs,
        get_affected_ref_range, get_affected_ref_commit_ids, and
        get_affected_ref_commits were transformed in Git::More
        methods, so that they can now keep the affected_refs
        information inside the objects.

        The Git::Hooks::grok_userenv routine was transformed into the
        Git::More::authenticated_user method.

        The Git::Hooks::git_config routine was transformed into the
        Git::More::config method.

        The method Git::More::get_commits now returns a list of
        commits and not an array-ref. This makes its usage simpler.

        * FIXES:

        The tests are now performed out of the distribution directory.
        By performing them in the distribution directory we run the
        risk of messing up with Git::Hooks own git repository, which
        can interfere with the tests too.

        * REFACTORINGS:

        Got rid of global variables in Git::Hooks and all state
        variables used throughout. This had a great impact in the
        code, adding arguments to several routines, turning Git::Hooks
        routines into Git::More methods, adding new methods

        The tests now prepare only the hooks that will be
        tested. Earlier we prepared all 16 hooks, which made the
        testing take longer.

        The compatibility with old plugin names that was implemented
        some commits ago was made more specific, affecting just the
        plugins CheckAcls, CheckJira, and CheckStructure. Those were
        the plugins that existed before the plugin name change.

0.024     2012-12-17 12:35:52 America/Sao_Paulo

        Implement a new plugin Git::Hooks::GerritChangeId which is a
        reimplementation of Gerrit's commit-msg official one
        (http://tinyurl.com/cglobb4, at Gerrit's v2.5.1).

        Improve code and documentation with the help of Code::TidyAll,
        Perl::Critic, Pod::Checker, and Pod::Spell.

0.023     2012-12-16 08:47:55 America/Sao_Paulo

	This version makes a large refactor in the code. The plugins
	were rewritten as proper modules so that they can be used by
	themselves, without the Git::Hooks framework. The only user
	visible change is that from now on the preferred way to
	configure plugins is by their CamelCase names (e.g. CheckJira
	instead of check-jira). But the old flattened names are still
	valid to keep compatibility with already set up repos.

	This version starts to require App::gh::Git version 0.56 in
	order to have a working App::gh::Git. It also starts to
	require File::Path version 2.08 for the testing phase in order
	to have a working make_path routine.

0.022     2012-12-06 23:13:44 America/Sao_Paulo

	Implement a new plugin called check-structure.pl which
	enforces the repository's file and reference structure.

0.021     2012-12-06 08:52:34 America/Sao_Paulo

	The configuration variables userenv and admin, which were
	available in the check-acls and check-jira plugins were
	promoted to the "githooks" configuration section. Along with
	them, the functions grok_userenv, match_user, and im_admin
	were also migrated to the Git::Hooks module so that they can
	be used by any access control plugin.  The old configuration
	variables in the plugins are still supported but are now
	documented as deprecated.

	Also improved the documentation slightly.

0.020     2012-11-20 21:56:51 America/Sao_Paulo

	Implement routine Git::Hooks::eval_gitconfig to make it easier
	to grok Perl expressions in config values.

	again!

0.018     2012-11-06 21:49:20 America/Sao_Paulo

	Fix a bug that prevented installed hooks to be invoked in the
	absence of any configured plugins. This was reported to me by

	Interpolate environment variables in the whole ACL
	specification for check-acls.

	Make the .pl extension optional in configuring plugins.

	Make im_memberof an exported routine of Git::Hooks.

	The group specification is now given by the githooks.groups
	variable. This is an incompatible change, since previously it
	was given by the check-acls.groups variable.

	Implement Git::More::get_affected_files. This routine returns
	a hash mapping every affected file in a sequence of commits to
	a letter telling its affected status.

	Allow check-acls.userenv be given by a code snippet to be
	evaluated.

0.001      2012-07-10 America/Sao_Paulo

	First release, with two hooks passing tests: check-acls.pl and

	I decided to incorporate Git::More in this distribution instead of
	making it a separate module.

	The documentation is lacking and the functionality needs to be
	expanded.
