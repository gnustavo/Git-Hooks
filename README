Git::Hooks - A framework for implementing Git hooks.

(THIS IS IN ALPHA STATUS.)

Instead of having separate scripts implementing different
functionality you may have a single script implementing all the
funcionality you need either directly or using some of the existing
plugins, which are implemented by Perl scripts in the Git::Hooks::
namespace. This single script can be used to implement all standard
hooks, because each hook knows when to perform based on the context in
which the script was called.
