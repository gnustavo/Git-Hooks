### Git::Hooks - A framework for implementing Git (and Gerrit) hooks.

Git::Hooks comes with plugins implementing several hooks that you can
use with Git and Gerrit. To use them you just need a single three-line
script and to configure them using the standard "git config" command.

Implementing new hooks is easy too. Simple hooks can be implemented as
a simple Perl function in the same script.
