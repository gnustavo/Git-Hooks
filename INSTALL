Git::Hooks is managed with Dist::Zilla, so that you can't install it
directly from the repository. Instead, you must download a package from CPAN
(https://metacpan.org/release/Git-Hooks) in order to install it the usual
Perl fashion:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

A Perl packager can do everything automatically for you:

    # with cpanm
    cpanm Git::Hooks

    # with CPAN
    cpan Git::Hooks

It's possible to use it directly from the Git repository, like so:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    use lib '/path/to/git/Git-Hooks/lib';
    use Git::Hooks;
    run_hooks($0, @ARGV);

The documentation is in the module file.  Once you install the file, you can
read it with perldoc.

    perldoc Git::Hooks

If you want to read it before you install it, you can use perldoc directly
on the module file.

    perldoc lib/Git/Hooks.pm

This module is also in Github
