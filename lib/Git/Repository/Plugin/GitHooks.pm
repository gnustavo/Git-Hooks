# Gerrit's patchset-created hook is invoked when a commit is pushed to a

# can't stop the push to happen. Instead, if it detects any problem, we must
# reject the commit via Gerrit's own revision process. So, we prepare a post
# hook action in which we see if there were errors that should be signaled
# via a code review action. Note, however, that draft changes can only be
# accessed by their respective owners and usually can't be voted on by the
# hook. So, draft changes aren't voted on and we exit the hook prematurely.
# The arguments for the hook are these:

# patchset-created --change <change id> --is-draft <boolean> \
# --kind <change kind> --change-url <change url> \
# --change-owner <change owner> --project <project name> \
# --branch <branch> --topic <topic> --uploader <uploader>
# --commit <sha1> --patchset <patchset id>

# Gerrit's draft-published hook is invoked when a draft change is
# published. In this state they're are visible by the hook and can be voted
# on. The arguments for the hook are these:

# draft-published --change <change id> --change-url <change url> \

=head1 NAME

Git::Repository::Plugin::GitHooks - Add useful methods for hooks to Git::Repository

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # load the plugin
    use Git::Repository 'GitHooks';

    my $git = Git::Repository->new();

    my $config  = $git->get_config();
    my $branch  = $git->get_current_branch();
    my @commits = $git->get_commits($oldcommit, $newcommit);

    my @files_modified_by_commit = $git->filter_files_in_index('AM');
    my @files_modified_by_push   = $git->filter_files_in_range('AM', $oldcommit, $newcommit);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds several methods useful to implement Git hooks to
B<Git::Repository>.

In particular, it is used by the standard hooks implemented by the
C<Git::Hooks> framework.

=head1 CONFIGURATION VARIABLES

=head2 CONFIG_ENCODING

Git configuration files usually contain just ASCII characters, but values
and sub-section names may contain any characters, except newline. If your
config files have non-ASCII characters you should ensure that they are
properly decoded by specifying their encoding like this:

    $Git::Repository::Plugin::GitHooks::CONFIG_ENCODING = 'UTF-8';

The acceptable values for this variable are all the encodings supported by
the C<Encode> module.

=head1 METHODS FOR THE GIT::HOOKS FRAMEWORK

The following methods are used by the Git::Hooks framework and are not
intended to be useful for hook developers. They're described here for
completeness.

=head2 prepare_hook NAME, ARGS

This is used by Git::Hooks::run_hooks to prepare the environment for
specific Git hooks before invoking the associated plugins. It's invoked with
the arguments passed by Git to the hook script. NAME is the script name
(usually the variable $0) and ARGS is a reference to an array containing the
script positional arguments.

=head2 load_plugins

This loads every plugin configured in the githooks.plugin option.

=head2 invoke_external_hooks ARGS...

This is used by Git::Hooks::run_hooks to invoke external hooks.

=head2 post_hooks

Returns the list of post hook functions registered with the post_hook method
below.

=head1 METHODS FOR HOOK DEVELOPERS

The following methods are intended to be useful for hook developers.

=head2 post_hook SUB

Plugin developers may be interested in performing some action depending on
the overall result of every check made by every other hook. As an example,
Gerrit's C<patchset-created> hook is invoked asynchronously, meaning that
the hook's exit code doesn't affect the action that triggered the hook. The
proper way to signal the hook result for Gerrit is to invoke it's API to
make a review. But we want to perform the review once, at the end of the
hook execution, based on the overall result of all enabled checks.

To do that, plugin developers can use this routine to register callbacks
that are invoked at the end of C<run_hooks>. The callbacks are called with
the following arguments:

=over

=item * HOOK_NAME

The basename of the invoked hook.

=item * GIT

The Git::Repository object that was passed to the plugin hooks.

=item * ARGS...

The remaining arguments that were passed to the plugin hooks.

=back

The callbacks may see if there were any errors signaled by the plugin hook
by invoking the C<get_errors> method on the GIT object. They may be used to
signal the hook result in any way they want, but they should not die or they
will prevent other post hooks to run.

=head2 cache SECTION

This may be used by plugin developers to cache information in the context of
a Git::Repository object. SECTION is any string which becomes associated
with a hash-ref. The method simply returns the hash-ref, which can be used
by the caller to store any kind of information. Plugin developers are
encouraged to use the plugin name as the SECTION string to avoid clashes.

=head2 get_config [SECTION [VARIABLE]]

This groks the configuration options for the repository by invoking C<git
config --list>. The configuration is cached during the first invocation in
the object C<Git::Repository> object. So, if the configuration is changed
afterwards, the method won't notice it. This is usually ok for hooks,
though, which are short-lived.

With no arguments, the options are returned as a hash-ref pointing to a
two-level hash. For example, if the config options are these:

    section1.a=1
    section1.b=2
    section1.b=3
    section2.x.a=A
    section2.x.b=B
    section2.x.b=C

Then, it'll return this hash:

    {
        'section1' => {
            'a' => [1],
            'b' => [2, 3],
        },
        'section2.x' => {
            'a' => ['A'],
            'b' => ['B', 'C'],
        },
    }

The first level keys are the part of the option names before the last
dot. The second level keys are everything after the last dot in the option
names. You won't get more levels than two. In the example above, you can see
that the option "section2.x.a" is split in two: "section2.x" in the first
level and "a" in the second.

The values are always array-refs, even it there is only one value to a
specific option. For some options, it makes sense to have a list of values
attached to them. But even if you expect a single value to an option you may
have it defined in the global scope and redefined in the local scope. In
this case, it will appear as a two-element array, the last one being the
local value.

So, if you want to treat an option as single-valued, you should fetch it
like this:

    $h->{section1}{a}[-1]
    $h->{'section2.x'}{a}[-1]

If the SECTION argument is passed, the method returns the second-level
hash for it. So, following the example above:

    $git->get_config('section1');

This call would return this hash:

    {
        'a' => [1],
        'b' => [2, 3],
    }

If the section doesn't exist an empty hash is returned. Any key/value added
to the returned hash will be available in subsequent invocations of
C<get_config>.

If the VARIABLE argument is also passed, the method returns the value(s) of
the configuration option C<SECTION.VARIABLE>. In list context the method
returns the list of all values or the empty list, if the variable isn't
defined. In scalar context, the method returns the variable's last value or
C<undef>, if it's not defined.

As a special case, options without values (i.e., with no equals sign after its
name in the configuration file) are set to the string 'true' to force Perl
recognize them as true Booleans.

=head2 get_config_boolean SECTION VARIABLE

Git configuration variables may be grokked as Booleans. (See C<git help
config>.)  There are specific values meaning B<true> (viz. C<yes>, C<on>,
C<true>, C<1>, and the absence of a value) and specific values meaning B<false>
(viz. C<no>, C<off>, C<false>, C<0>, and the empty string).

This method checks the variable's value and returns 1 or 0 representing Boolean
values in Perl. If the variable's value isn't recognized as a Git Boolean the
method croaks. If the variable isn't defined the method returns undef.

In the L<Git::Hooks> documentation, all configuration variables mentioning a
C<BOOL> value are grokked with this method.

=head2 get_config_integer SECTION VARIABLE

Git configuration variables may be grokked as integers. (See C<git help
config>.)  They may start with an optional signal (C<+> or C<->), followed by
one or more decimal digits, and end with an optional scaling factor letter,
viz. C<k> (1024), C<m> (1024*1024), or C<g> (1024*1024*1024). The scaling factor
may be in lower or upper-case.

This method checks the variable's value format and returns the corresponding
Perl integer.  If the variable's value isn't recognized as a Git integer the
method croaks. If the variable isn't defined the method returns undef.

In the L<Git::Hooks> documentation, all configuration variables mentioning an
C<INT> value are grokked with this method.

=head2 fault MESSAGE INFO

This method should be used by plugins to record consistent error or warning
messages. It gets one or two arguments. MESSAGE is a multi-line string
explaining the error. INFO is an optional hash-ref which may contain additional
information about the message, which will be used to complement it.

A "complete" fault is formatted like this:

  [PREFIX: CONTEXT]

  MESSAGE

    DETAILS

PREFIX gives contextual information about the message. It can be set via the
C<prefix> INFO hash key. If not, the package name of the function which called
C<fault> is used, which usually happens to be the name of the plugin which
detected the error.

CONTEXT is additional contextual information, such as a reference name, a
commit SHA-1, and a violated configuration option.

MESSAGE is the multi-line error message.

DETAILS is a multi-line string giving more details about the error. Usually
showing error output from an external command.

Besides the MESSAGE, which is required, and the PREFIX, which has a default
value, all other items must be informed via the INFO hash-ref with the following
keys:

=over 4

=item * B<prefix>

A string giving broad contextual information about the error message. When
absent, the prefix used is the package name of the function which called
C<fault>, which is usually a Git::Hooks plugin name.

=item * B<commit>

The SHA-1 or a Git::Repository::Log object representing a commit. It is informed
in the CONTEXT area like this (as a short SHA-1):

  [PREFIX: commit SHA-1]

=item * B<ref>

The name of a Git reference (usually a branch). It is informed in the CONTEXT
area like this:

  [PREFIX: on ref REF]

=item * B<option>

The name of a configuration option related to the error message. It is informed
in the CONTEXT area like this:

  [PREFIX: violates option 'OPTION']

=item * B<details>

A string containing details about the error message. If present, it is appended
to the MESSAGE, separated by an empty line, and with its lines prefixed by two
spaces.

=back

The method simply records the formatted error message and returns. It
doesn't die.

The messages can be colorized if they go to a terminal. This can be configured
by the configuration options C<githooks.color> and C<< githooks.color.<slot> >>,
which are explained in the section L<Git::Hooks/CONFIGURATION> documentation.

=head2 get_faults

This method returns a string specially formatted with all error messages
recorded with the C<fault> method, a header, and a footer, if requested by
configuration.

=head2 error PREFIX MESSAGE [DETAILS]

This method is DEPRECATED. Please, use C<fault> instead.

=head2 get_errors

This method is DEPRECATED. Please, use C<get_faults> instead.

=head2 undef_commit

The undefined commit is a special SHA-1 used by Git in the update and
pre-receive hooks to signify that a reference either was just created (as
the old commit) or has been just deleted (as the new commit). It consists of
40 zeroes.

=head2 empty_tree

The empty tree represents an L<empty directory for
Git|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9765453/is-gits-semi-secret-empty-tree-object-reliable-and-why-is-there-not-a-symbolic>.

=head2 get_commit COMMIT

Returns a L<Git::Repository::Log> object representing COMMIT.

=head2 get_commits OLDCOMMIT NEWCOMMIT [OPTIONS [PATHS]]

Returns a list of L<Git::Repository::Log> objects representing every commit
reachable from NEWCOMMIT but not from OLDCOMMIT.

There are two special cases, though:

If NEWCOMMIT is the undefined commit, i.e.,
'0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', this means that a branch,
pointing to OLDCOMMIT, has been removed. In this case the method returns an
empty list, meaning that no new commit has been created.

If OLDCOMMIT is the undefined commit, this means that a new branch pointing
to NEWCOMMIT is being created. In this case we want all commits reachable
from NEWCOMMIT but not reachable from any other branch. The syntax for this
is NEWCOMMIT ^B1 ^B2 ... ^Bn", i.e., NEWCOMMIT followed by every other
branch name prefixed by carets. We can get at their names using the
technique described in, e.g., L<this
discussion|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3511057/git-receive-update-hooks-and-new-branches>.

The L<Git::Repository::Log> objects are constructed ultimately by invoking the
C<git log> command like this:

  git log [<options>] <revision range> [-- <paths>]

The C<revision range> is usually just C<OLDCOMMIT..NEWCOMMIT>, but there are
some special cases which require some calculating as discussed above.

The C<OPTIONS> optional argument is an array-ref pointing to an array of
strings, which will be passed as options to the git-log command. It may be
useful to grok some extra information about each commit (e.g., using
C<--name-status>).

The C<PATHS> optional argument is an array-ref pointing to an array of strings,
which will be passed as pathspecs to the git-log command. It may be useful to
filter the list of commits, grokking only those affecting specific paths in the
repository.

=head2 read_commit_msg_file FILENAME

Returns the relevant contents of the commit message file called
FILENAME. It's useful during the C<commit-msg> and the C<prepare-commit-msg>
hooks.

The file is read using the character encoding defined by the
C<i18n.commitencoding> configuration option or C<utf-8> if not defined.

Some non-relevant contents are stripped off the file. Specifically:

=over

=item * diff data

Sometimes, the commit message file contains the diff data for the
commit. This data begins with a line starting with the fixed string C<diff
--git a/>. Everything from such a line on is stripped off the file.

=item * comment lines

Every line beginning with a C<#> character is stripped off the file.

=item * trailing spaces

Any trailing space is stripped off from all lines in the file.

=item * trailing empty lines

Any empty line at the end is stripped off from the file, making sure it ends
in a single newline.

=back

All this cleanup is performed to make it easier for different plugins to
analyze the commit message using a canonical base.

=head2 write_commit_msg_file FILENAME, MSG, ...

Writes the list of strings C<MSG> to FILENAME. It's useful during the
C<commit-msg> and the C<prepare-commit-msg> hooks.

The file is written to using the character encoding defined by the
C<i18n.commitencoding> configuration option or C<utf-8> if not defined.

An empty line (C<\n\n>) is inserted between every pair of MSG arguments, if
there is more than one, of course.

=head2 get_affected_refs

Returns the list of names of the references affected by the current push
command. It's useful in the C<update> and the C<pre-receive> hooks.

=head2 get_affected_ref_range REF

Returns the two-element list of commit ids representing the OLDCOMMIT and
the NEWCOMMIT of the affected REF.

=head2 get_affected_ref_commits REF [OPTIONS [PATHS]]

Returns the list of commits leading from the affected REF's NEWCOMMIT to
OLDCOMMIT. The commits are represented by L<Git::Repository::Log> objects,
as returned by the C<get_commits> method.

The optional arguments OPTIONS and PATHS are passed to the C<get_commits>
method.

=head2 filter_name_status_in_index FILTER

Returns a hash with information about files changed in the index (aka stage area
or cache) compared to HEAD. The hash maps file names to their respective
statuses, which are uppercase letters, as returned by the C<git diff-index
--name-status> command. It's useful in the C<pre-commit> hook when you want to
know which files are being modified in the upcoming commit.

FILTER specifies in which kind of changes you're interested in. It's passed
as the argument to the C<--diff-filter> option of C<git diff-index>, which
is documented like this:

  --diff-filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)...[*]]

    Select only files that are Added (A), Copied (C), Deleted (D), Modified
    (M), Renamed (R), have their type (i.e. regular file, symlink,
    submodule, ...) changed (T), are Unmerged (U), are Unknown (X), or have
    had their pairing Broken (B). Any combination of the filter characters
    (including none) can be used. When * (All-or-none) is added to the
    combination, all paths are selected if there is any file that matches
    other criteria in the comparison; if there is no file that matches other
    criteria, nothing is selected.

=head2 filter_name_status_in_range FILTER FROM TO [OPTIONS [PATHS]]

Returns a hash with information about files that are changed between commits
FROM and TO. The hash maps file names to their respective statuses, which are
uppercase letters, as returned by the C<git diff-tree --name-status>
command. It's useful in the C<update> and the C<pre-receive> hooks when you want
to know which files are being modified in the commits being received by a C<git
push> command.

FILTER specifies in which kind of changes you're interested in. Please, read
about it in the C<filter_name_status_in_index> method above.

FROM and TO are revision parameters (see C<git help revisions>) specifying
two commits. They're passed as arguments to the C<git diff-tree> command in
order to compare them and grok the files that differ between them.

A special case occurs when FROM is the undefined commit, which happens when
we're calculating the commit range in a pre-receive or update hook and a new
branch or tag has been pushed. In this case we pass FROM and TO to the
C<get_commits> method to find the list of new commits being pushed and
calculate the difference between the first commit's parent and TO. When the
first commit has no parent (in case it's a root commit) we return an empty
list.

The optional arguments OPTIONS and PATHS are passed to the C<get_commits>
method.

=head2 filter_name_status_in_commit FILTER, COMMIT

Returns a hash with information about files that are changed in COMMIT. The hash
maps file names to their respective statuses, which are uppercase letters, as
returned by the C<git diff-tree --name-status> command. It's useful in the
C<patchset-created> and the C<draft-published> hooks when you want to know which
files are being modified in the single commit being received by a C<git push>
command.

FILTER specifies in which kind of changes you're interested in. Please, read
about it in the C<filter_name_status_in_index> method above.

COMMIT is a revision parameter (see C<git help revisions>) specifying the
commit. It's passed a argument to C<git diff-tree> in order to compare it to
its parents and grok the files that changed in it.

Merge commits are treated specially. Only files that are changed in COMMIT with
respect to all of its parents are returned. The reasoning behind this is that if
a file isn't changed with respect to one or more of COMMIT's parents, then it
must have been checked already in those commits and we don't need to check it
again. In this case, since the files may have been changed differently in each
branch (added, modified, deleted, etc.), the hash values are strings of letters,
one for each branch.

=head2 filter_files_in_index FILTER

Returns the sorted keys of the hash that would be returned by the
C<filter_name_status_in_index> method if invoked with the same arguments.

=head2 filter_files_in_range FILTER FROM TO [OPTIONS [PATHS]]

Returns the sorted keys of the hash that would be returned by the
C<filter_name_status_in_range> method if invoked with the same arguments.

=head2 filter_files_in_commit FILTER, COMMIT

Returns the sorted keys of the hash that would be returned by the
C<filter_name_status_in_commit> method if invoked with the same arguments.

=head2 authenticated_user

Returns the username of the authenticated user performing the Git action. It
groks it from the C<githooks.userenv> configuration variable specification,
which is described in the L<Git::Hooks> documentation. It's useful for most
access control check plugins.

=head2 repository_name

Returns the repository name as a string. Currently it knows how to grok the name
from Gerrit and Bitbucket servers. Otherwise it tries to grok it from the
C<GIT_DIR> environment variable, which holds the path to the Git repository.

=head2 get_current_branch

Returns the repository's current branch name, as indicated by the C<git
symbolic-ref HEAD> command.

If the repository is in a detached head state, i.e., if HEAD points
to a commit instead of to a branch, the method returns undef.

=head2 get_sha1 REV

Returns the SHA1 of the commit represented by REV, using the command

  git rev-parse --verify REV

It's useful, for instance, to grok the HEAD's SHA1 so that you can pass it
to the get_commit method.

=head2 get_head_or_empty_tree

Returns the string "HEAD" if the repository already has commits. Otherwise,
if it is a brand new repository, it returns the SHA1 representing the empty
tree. It's useful to come up with the correct argument for, e.g., C<git
diff> during a pre-commit hook. (See the default pre-commit.sample script
which comes with Git to understand how this is used.)

=head2 blob REV, FILE, ARGS...

Returns the name of a temporary file into which the contents of the file
FILE in revision REV has been copied.

It's useful for hooks that need to read the contents of changed files in
order to check anything in them.

These objects are cached so that if more than one hook needs to get at them
they're created only once.

By default, all temporary files are removed when the L<Git::Repository> object
is destroyed.

Any remaining ARGS are passed as arguments to C<File::Temp::newdir> so that you
can have more control over the temporary file creation.

If REV:FILE does not exist or if there is any other error while trying to
fetch its contents the method dies.

=head2 file_size REV FILE

Returns the size (in bytes) of FILE (a path relative to the repository root)
in revision REV.

=head2 file_mode REV FILE

Returns the mode (as a number) of FILE (a path relative to the repository root)
in revision REV.

=head2 is_reference_enabled REF

This method should be invoked by hooks to see if REF is enabled according to
the C<githooks.ref> and C<githooks.noref> options. Please, read about these
options in L<Git::Hooks> documentation.

REF must be a complete reference name or undef. Local hooks should pass the
current branch, and server hooks should pass the references affected by the push
command. If REF is undef, the method returns true.

The method decides if a reference is enabled using the following algorithm:

=over

=item * If REF matches any REFSPEC in C<githooks.ref> then it is B<enabled>.

=item * Else, if REF matches any REFSPEC in C<githooks.noref> then it is B<disabled>.

=item * Else, it is B<enabled>.

=back

=head2 is_ref_enabled REF, SPECs...

This method is DEPRECATED. Please, use the C<is_reference_enabled> method
instead.

Returns a Boolean indicating if REF matches one of the ref-specs in
SPECS. REF is the complete name of a Git ref and SPECS is a list of strings,
each one specifying a rule for matching ref names.

As a special case, it returns true if REF is undef or if there is no SPEC
whatsoever, meaning that by default all refs/commits are enabled.

You may want to use it, for example, in an C<update>, C<pre-receive>, or
C<post-receive> hook which may be enabled depending on the particular refs
being affected.

Each SPEC rule may indicate the matching refs as the complete ref name
(e.g. C<refs/heads/master>) or by a regular expression starting with a caret
(C<^>), which is kept as part of the regexp.

=head2 match_user SPEC

Checks if the authenticated user (as returned by the C<authenticated_user>
method above) matches the specification, which may be given in one of the
three different forms acceptable for the C<githooks.admin> configuration
configuration option, i.e., as a C<username>, as a C<@group>, or as a
C<^regex>.

=head2 im_admin

Checks if the authenticated user (again, as returned by the
C<authenticated_user> method) matches the specifications given by the
C<githooks.admin> configuration variable. This is useful to exempt
"administrators" from the restrictions imposed by the hooks.

=head2 grok_acls CFG ACTIONS

This method returns a list of ACLs (Access Control Lists) grokked from the
C<CFG.acl> options, where CFG is a configuration session like
C<githooks.checkfile>.

The C<CFG.acl> is a multi-valued option specifying rules allowing or denying
specific users to perform specific actions on specific "things". (Commons such
things are references and files). By default any user can perform any action on
any thing. So, the rules are used to impose restrictions.

When a hook is invoked it groks all things that were affected in any way by the
commits involved and tries to match each of them to a RULE to see if the action
performed on it is allowed or denied.

A RULE takes three or four parts, like this:

  (allow|deny) [ACTIONS]+ <spec> (by <userspec>)?

=over 4

=item * B<(allow|deny)>

The first part tells if the rule allows or denies an action.

=item * B<[ACTIONS]+>

The second part specifies which actions are being considered by a combination of
letters. The ACTIONS argument is a string containing all valid letters for the
corresponding ACLs.

See the documentation of the C<acl> option in the L<Git::Hooks::CheckFile> and
the L<Git::Hooks::CheckReference> plugins for two examples of this.

=item * B<< <spec> >>

The third part specifies which things are being considered. In its simplest
form, a C<spec> is taken as a literal string matching the thing exactly by name.

If the C<spec> starts with a caret (^) it's interpreted as a Perl regular
expression, the caret being kept as part of the regexp. These specs match
potentially many things.

Before being interpreted as a string or as a regexp, any sub-string of it in the
form C<{VAR}> is replaced by C<$ENV{VAR}>. This is useful, for example, to
interpolate the committer's username in the spec, in order to create personal
name spaces for users.

(See the documentation of the C<acl> option in the L<Git::Hooks::CheckFile> and
the L<Git::Hooks::CheckReference> plugins for examples things as files and
references, respectively.)

=item * B<< by <userspec> >>

The fourth part is optional. It specifies which users are being considered. It
can be the name of a single user (e.g. C<james>) or the name of a group
(e.g. C<@devs>).

If not specified, the RULE matches any user.

=back

The RULEs B<are matched in the reverse order> as they appear in the result of
the command C<git config CFG.acl>, so that later rules take precedence. This way
you can have general rules in the global context and more specific rules in the
repository context, naturally.

So, the B<last> RULE matching the action, the file, and the user, tells if the
operation is allowed or denied.

If no RULE matches the operation, it is allowed by default.

In the returned list, each ACL is represented by a hash with the following keys:

=over

=item * B<acl>

Contains the original representation of the ACL, which is useful in producing
error messages.

=item * B<allow>

A Boolean telling if the ACL is an "allow".

=item * B<action>

The string representation of the action (e.g. 'AMD' or 'CRUD').

=item * B<spec>

The spec, which can be either a string or a pre-compiled regex object.

=item * B<who>

The name of a user or of a group.

=back

As an optimization, only ACLs matching the current user, either explicitly or by
not having a WHO part, are returned in the list.
