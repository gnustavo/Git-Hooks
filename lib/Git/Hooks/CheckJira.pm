=head1 NAME

CheckJira - Git::Hooks plugin which requires citation of JIRA
issues in commit messages.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Git::Hooks plugin hooks itself to the hooks below to guarantee
that every commit message cites at least one valid JIRA issue key in
its log message, so that you can be certain that every change has a
proper change request (a.k.a. ticket) open.

=over

=item * B<commit-msg>

This hook is invoked during the commit, to check if the commit message
cites valid JIRA issues.

=item * B<update>

This hook is invoked multiple times in the remote repository during
C<git push>, once per branch being updated, to check if the commit
message cites valid JIRA issues.

=item * B<pre-receive>

This hook is invoked once in the remote repository during C<git push>,
to check if the commit message cites valid JIRA issues.

=item * B<ref-update>

This hook is invoked when a push request is received by Gerrit Code
Review, to check if the commit message cites valid JIRA issues.

=item * B<patchset-created>

This hook is invoked when a push request is received by Gerrit Code
Review for a virtual branch (refs/for/*), to check if the commit
message cites valid JIRA issues.

=back

It requires that any Git commits affecting all or some branches must
make reference to valid JIRA issues in the commit log message. JIRA
issues are cited by their keys which, by default, consist of a
sequence of uppercase letters separated by an hyphen from a sequence of
digits. E.g., C<CDS-123>, C<RT-1>, and C<GIT-97>.

To enable it you should add it to the githooks.plugin configuration
option:

    git config --add githooks.plugin CheckJira

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The plugin is configured by the following git options.

=head2 githooks.checkjira.ref REFSPEC

By default, the message of every commit is checked. If you want to
have them checked only for some refs (usually some branch under
refs/heads/), you may specify them with one or more instances of this
option.

The refs can be specified as a complete ref name
(e.g. "refs/heads/master") or by a regular expression starting with a
caret (C<^>), which is kept as part of the regexp
(e.g. "^refs/heads/(master|fix)").

=head2 githooks.checkjira.userenv STRING

This variable is deprecated. Please, use the C<githooks.userenv>
variable, which is defined in the Git::Hooks module. Please, see its
documentation to understand it.

=head2 githooks.checkjira.admin USERSPEC

This variable is deprecated. Please, use the C<githooks.admin>
variable, which is defined in the Git::Hooks module. Please, see its
documentation to understand it.

=head2 githooks.checkjira.jiraurl URL

This option specifies the JIRA server HTTP URL, used to construct the
C<JIRA::REST> object which is used to interact with your JIRA
server. Please, see the JIRA::REST documentation to know about them.

=head2 githooks.checkjira.jirauser USERNAME

This option specifies the JIRA server username, used to construct the
C<JIRA::REST> object.

=head2 githooks.checkjira.jirapass PASSWORD

This option specifies the JIRA server password, used to construct the
C<JIRA::REST> object.

=head2 githooks.checkjira.matchkey REGEXP

By default, JIRA keys are matched with the regex
C</\b[A-Z][A-Z]+-\d+\b/>, meaning, a sequence of two or more capital
letters, followed by an hyphen, followed by a sequence of digits. If
you customized your L<JIRA project
keys|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+Project+Keys>,
you may need to customize how this hook is going to match them. Set
this option to a suitable regex to match a complete JIRA issue key.

=head2 githooks.checkjira.matchlog REGEXP

By default, JIRA keys are looked for in all of the commit message. However,
this can lead to some false positives, since the default issue pattern can
match other things besides JIRA issue keys. You may use this option to
restrict the places inside the commit message where the keys are going to be
looked for. You do this by specifying a regular expression with a capture
group (a pair of parenthesis) in it. The commit message is matched against
the regular expression and the JIRA tickets are looked for only within the
part that matched the capture group.

Here are some examples:

=over

=item * C<\[([^]]+)\]>

Looks for JIRA keys inside the first pair of brackets found in the
message.

=item * C<(?s)^\[([^]]+)\]>

Looks for JIRA keys inside a pair of brackets that must be at the
beginning of the message's title.

=item * C<(?im)^Bug:(.*)>

Looks for JIRA keys in a line beginning with C<Bug:>. This is a common
convention around some high caliber projects, such as OpenStack and
Wikimedia.

=back

This is a multi-valued option. You may specify it more than once. All
regexes are tried and JIRA keys are looked for in all of them. This
allows you to more easily accomodate more than one way of specifying
JIRA keys if you wish.

=head2 githooks.checkjira.project KEY

By default, the committer can reference any JIRA issue in the commit
log. You can restrict the allowed keys to a set of JIRA projects by
specifying a JIRA project key to this option. You can allow more than one
project by specifying this option multiple times, once per project key.

If you set this option, then any cited JIRA issue that doesn't belong to one
of the specified projects causes an error.

=head2 githooks.checkjira.require [01]

By default, the log must reference at least one JIRA issue. You can
make the reference optional by setting this option to 0.

=head2 githooks.checkjira.unresolved [01]

By default, every issue referenced must be unresolved, i.e., it must
not have a resolution. You can relax this requirement by setting this
option to 0.

=head2 githooks.checkjira.status STATUSNAME

By default, it doesn't matter in which status the JIRA issues are. By
setting this multi-valued option you can restrict the valid statuses for the
issues.

=head2 githooks.checkjira.issuetype ISSUETYPENAME

By default, it doesn't matter what type of JIRA issues are cited. By setting
this multi-valued option you can restrict the valid issue types.

=head2 githooks.checkjira.fixversion BRANCH FIXVERSION

This multi-valued option allows you to specify that commits affecting BRANCH
must cite only issues that have their C<Fix For Version> field matching
FIXVERSION. This may be useful if you have release branches associated with
particular JIRA versions.

BRANCH can be specified as a complete ref name (e.g. "refs/heads/master") or
by a regular expression starting with a caret (C<^>), which is kept as part
of the regexp (e.g. "^refs/heads/(master|fix)").

FIXVERSION can be specified as a complete JIRA version name (e.g. "1.2.3")
or by a regular expression starting with a caret (C<^>), which is kept as
part of the regexp (e.g. "^1\.2").

As a special feature, if BRANCH is a regular expression containing capture
groups, then every occurrence of the substring C<$+> in FIXVERSION, if any,
is replaced by the text matched by the last capture group in BRANCH. (Hint:
Perl's C<$+> variable is defined as "The text matched by the last bracket of
the last successful search pattern.") If FIXVERSION is also a regular
expression, the C<$+> are replaced by the text properly escaped so that it
matches literally.

Commits that do not affect any BRANCH are accepted by default.

So, suppose you have this configuration:

  [githooks "checkjira"]
    fixversion = refs/heads/master          future
    fixversion = ^refs/heads/(\d+\.\d+)\.   ^$+

Then, commits affecting the C<master> branch must cite issues assigned to
the C<future> version. Also, commits affecting any branch which name begins
with a version number (e.g. C<1.0.3>) be assinged to the corresponding JIRA
version (e.g. C<1.0>).

=head2 githooks.checkjira.by-assignee [01]

By default, the committer can reference any valid JIRA issue. Setting
this value 1 requires that the user doing the push/commit (as
specified by the C<userenv> configuration variable) be the current
issue's assignee.

=head2 githooks.checkjira.check-code CODESPEC

If the above checks aren't enough you can use this option to define a
custom code to check your commits. The code may be specified directly
as the option's value or you may specify it indirectly via the
filename of a script. If the option's value starts with "file:", the
remaining is treated as the script filename, which is executed by a do
command. Otherwise, the option's value is executed directly by an
eval. Either way, the code must end with the definition of a routine,
which will be called once for each commit with the following
arguments:

=over

=item * B<GIT>

The Git repository object used to grok information about the commit.

=item * B<COMMITID>

The SHA-1 id of the Git commit. It is undef in the C<commit-msg> hook,
because there is no commit yet.

=item * B<JIRA>

The JIRA::REST object used to talk to the JIRA server.

Note that up to version 0.047 of Git::Hooks::CheckJira this used to be a
JIRA::Client object, which uses JIRA's SOAP API which was deprecated on JIRA
6.0 and won't be available anymore on JIRA 7.0.

If you have code relying on the JIRA::Client module you're advised to
rewrite it using the JIRA::REST module. As a stopgap measure you can
disregard the JIRA::REST object and create your own JIRA::Client object.

=item * B<ISSUES...>

The remaining arguments are RemoteIssue objects representing the
issues being cited by the commit's message.

=back

The subroutine should return a boolean value indicating success. Any
errors should be produced by invoking the B<Git::More::error> method.

If the subroutine returns undef it's considered to have succeeded.

If it raises an exception (e.g., by invoking B<die>) it's considered
to have failed and a proper message is produced to the user.

=head1 EXPORTS

This module exports two routines that can be used directly without
using all of Git::Hooks infrastructure.

=head2 check_affected_refs GIT

This is the routine used to implement the C<update> and the
C<pre-receive> hooks. It needs a C<Git::More> object.

=head2 check_message_file GIT, MSGFILE

This is the routine used to implement the C<commit-msg> hook. It needs
a C<Git::More> object and the name of a file containing the commit
message.

=head2 check_patchset GIT, HASH

This is the routine used to implement the C<patchset-created> Gerrit
hook. It needs a C<Git::More> object and the hash containing the
arguments passed to the hook by Gerrit.
