You just performed an unsafe "git commit --amend" because your

        $git->fault(<<"EOS");
You just performed an unsafe rebase because it would rewrite commits shared
by $branch and the following other branch(es):

  $branches

If the rebase was just effected, you can reset your branch to its previous
commit with the command:

  git reset --hard \@{1}

But be sure to understand the consequences of this command, as it can
potentially make you lose work.

=head1 NAME

Git::Hooks::CheckRewrite - Git::Hooks plugin for checking against unsafe rewrites

=head1 SYNOPSIS

As a C<Git::Hooks> plugin you don't use this Perl module directly. Instead, you
may configure it in a Git configuration file like this:

  [githooks]

    # Enable the plugin
    plugin = CheckRewrite

    # These users are exempt from all checks
    admin = joe molly

This section enables the plugin and defines the users C<joe> and C<molly> as
administrators, effectively exempting them from any restrictions the plugin may
impose.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Git::Hooks> plugin hooks itself to the B<pre-rebase> hook to
guarantee that it is safe in the sense that no rewritten commit is reachable
by other branch than the one being rebased.

It also hooks itself to the B<pre-commit> and the B<post-commit> hooks
to detect unsafe B<git commit --amend> commands after the fact. An
amend is unsafe if the original commit is still reachable by any
branch after being amended. Unfortunately B<git> still does not
provide a way to detect unsafe amends before committing them.

To enable it you should add it to the githooks.plugin configuration
option:

    [githooks]
      plugin = CheckRewrite

=head1 CONFIGURATION

There's no configuration needed or provided.

unsafe and how to go about detecting them in git:
