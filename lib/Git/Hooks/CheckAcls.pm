=head1 NAME

Git::Hooks::CheckAcls - [DEPRECATED] Git::Hooks plugin for branch/tag access control

=head1 SYNOPSIS

As a C<Git::Hooks> plugin you don't use this Perl module directly. Instead, you
may configure it in a Git configuration file like this:

  [githooks]

    # Enable the plugin
    plugin = CheckAcls

    # These users are exempt from all checks
    admin = joe molly

  [githooks "checkacls"]

    # Any user can create, rewrite, update, and delete branches prefixed with
    # their own usernames.
    acl = ^.      CRUD ^refs/heads/{USER}/

    # Any user can update any branch.
    acl = ^.      U    ^refs/heads/

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin is deprecated. Please, use the L<Git::Hooks::CheckReference> plugin
instead.

This L<Git::Hooks> plugin hooks itself to the hooks below to guarantee that
only allowed users can push commits and tags to specific branches.

=over

=item * B<update>

This hook is invoked multiple times in the remote repository during
C<git push>, once per branch being updated, checking if the user
performing the push can update the branch in question.

=item * B<pre-receive>

This hook is invoked once in the remote repository during C<git push>,
checking if the user performing the push can update every affected
branch.

=item * B<ref-update>

This hook is invoked when a push request is received by Gerrit Code
Review, to check if the user performing the push can update the branch
in question.

=item * B<commit-received>

This hook is invoked when a push request is received by Gerrit Code Review to
create a change for review, to check if the user performing the push can update
the branch in question.

=item * B<submit>

This hook is invoked when a change is submitted in Gerrit Code Review, to check
if the user performing the push can update the branch in question.

=back

To enable it you should add it to the githooks.plugin configuration
option:

    [githooks]
      plugin = CheckAcls

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The plugin is configured by the following git options under the
C<githooks.checkacls> subsection.

It can be disabled for specific references via the C<githooks.ref> and
C<githooks.noref> options about which you can read in the L<Git::Hooks>
documentation.

=head2 acl ACL

The authorization specification for a repository is defined by the set
of ACLs defined by this option. Each ACL specify 'who' has 'what' kind
of access to which refs, by means of a string with three components
separated by spaces:

    who what refs

By default, nobody has access to anything, except the users specified by the
C<githooks.admin> configuration option. During an update, all the ACLs are
processed in the order defined by the C<git config --list> command. The
first ACL matching the authenticated username and the affected reference
name (usually a branch) defines what operations are allowed. If no ACL
matches username and reference name, then the operation is denied.

The 'who' component specifies to which users this ACL gives access. It can
be specified as a username, a groupname, or a regex, like the
C<githooks.admin> configuration option.

The 'what' component specifies what kind of access to allow. It's
specified as a string of one or more of the following opcodes:

=over

=item * B<C> - Create a new ref.

=item * B<R> - Rewrite an existing ref. (With commit loss.)

=item * B<U> - Update an existing ref. (A fast-forward with no commit loss.)

=item * B<D> - Delete an existing ref.

=back

You may specify that the user has B<no> access whatsoever to the
references by using a single hyphen (C<->) as the what component.

The 'refs' component specifies which refs this ACL applies to. It can
be specified in one of these formats:

=over

=item * B<^REGEXP>

A regular expression anchored at the beginning of the reference name.
For example, "^refs/heads", meaning every branch.

=item * B<!REGEXP>

A negated regular expression. For example, "!^refs/heads/master",
meaning everything but the master branch.

=item * B<STRING>

The complete name of a reference. For example, "refs/heads/master".

=back

The ACL specification can embed strings in the format C<{VAR}>. These
strings are substituted by the corresponding environment's variable
VAR value. This interpolation occurs before the components are split
and processed.

This is useful, for instance, if you want developers to be restricted
in what they can do to official branches but to have complete control
with their own branch name space.

    [githooks "checkacls"]
      acl = ^. CRUD ^refs/heads/{USER}/
      acl = ^. U    ^refs/heads

In this example, every user (^.) has complete control (CRUD) to the
branches below "refs/heads/{USER}". Supposing the environment variable
USER contains the user's login name during a "pre-receive" hook. For
all other branches (^refs/heads) the users have only update (U) rights.

=head1 REFERENCES

=over

=item * L<update-paranoid|https://github.com/gitster/git/blob/b12905140a8239ac687450ad43f18b5f0bcfb62e/contrib/hooks/update-paranoid>

This script is heavily inspired (and, in some places, derived) from the
example hook which comes with the Git distribution.
