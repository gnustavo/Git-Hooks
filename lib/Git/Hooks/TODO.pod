=head1 TO-DO list of niceties for the future of Git::Hooks.

The following list is no order whatsoever. Any comments or other suggestion
are welcome at gnustavo AT cpan.org.

=head2 Support the WIN32 Platform

Currently we abort the build on C<Makefile.PL>.

=head2 Improve documentation

We need:

=over

=item * A plugin developer tutorial

=item * Revise documentation and make it more uniform

=item * Follow the advice in L<13 Things People Hate about Your Open Source
Docs|http://blog.smartbear.com/careers/13-things-people-hate-about-your-open-source-docs/>

=back

=head2 I18N

Use Locale::TextDomain to internationalize it?

=head2 L10N pt_BR

As a first job after i18n I intend to nationalize it to Brazilian
Portuguese.

=head2 In CheckAcls implement DENY for ACL operations

Along the lines of NFSv4 ACLs
(L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5661#section-6>). I'm thinking about
prefixing the what component with a '!'.

=head2 Implement equivalents for the L<SVN::Hooks> plugins

Currently we're missing DenyFilenames and UpdateConfFile. Actually, I'm
thinking that UpdateConfFile is too much specific. Perhaps something along
the lines of this post-update hook would be more interesting:
L<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/279169/deploy-a-project-using-git-push>.

=head2 Implement the Scott Chacon example hooks

In L<https://github.com/schacon/githooks>.

=head2 In CheckLog allow for stop words

C<CheckLog.spelling> should have a way to register stop words. I'd
have to ask for a change in Text::SpellChecker.

=head2 CheckLog should check the footer of the commit log message

The Gerrit default C<commit-msg> implements some checks that could be
used here. Some other things to check:

=over

=item Require Signed-off-by lines
(L<https://github.com/icefox/git-hooks/blob/master/git_hooks/commit-msg/signed-off-by>)

=item Duplicate Signed-off-by lines
(L<https://github.com/icefox/git-hooks/blob/master/contrib/commit-msg/duplicate-signedoffby>)

=back

=head2 CheckJira post-receive hook

Mikko Koivunalho suggested that Git::Hooks::CheckJira could be modified so
that it would not just check that the ticket exists, but actually copy the
commit message to the ticket.

=head2 Turn t/test-functions.pl into a module

Idea provided by Skye Shaw to make its functions usable by third-party
plugins. Something like Git::Hooks::Test.

=head2 Emulate the uploadvalidator Gerrit plugin

L<https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/uploadvalidator/+/master/src/main/resources/Documentation/config.md>
